# BinaryHeap-Based-Implementation-of-Dijkstra-s-Algorithm
An extremely fast and efficient implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm achieved by using a binary-heap based priority queue system.


Can be run in the following way through the command prompt: 

`java RunShortestPaths v4.8.64 v8.4.96 < random_16_16_256.in` 


Where v4.8.64 is the source vertex and v8.4.96 is the destination vertex. With over 65,000 vertices and over 250,000 edges connecting them, this implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm can calculate the distance between any two points in a matter of seconds thanks to the use of a binary heap-based priority queue.
